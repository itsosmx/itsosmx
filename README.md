### Don't `#Comment` Bad Code Rewrite It!
Hi, I'm **[OSMX](https://www.osmx.me/)** (Osama Hussein) `Person who love coding all time and his keyboard's sound more.`

**Self-taught full stack developer designing and developing websites/applications**

`My journey:`
Since beginning my journey in 2015, the topic was a blogger, blog to write technical articles but soon after, I began to ask how can I make this blog? After a little searching, I found that I should first learn `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. After some learning, I made several simple websites but that wasn't enough for me. Because I was wondering all time how I could do this and that. After watching a lot of videos and reading more articles I discover something called `API` and this was the real beginning for me I started to learn API using `Node.js` with that I developed a lot of Discord Applications (Bots) using Discord API (A program for chatting voice and text popular among gamers). from that I thought it will be awesome to start a real project for myself, so I developed a discord bot to do whatever discord API offered, on the way, to learn more and develop the bot more I learned `Mongoose`, `React.js`, `React Native`, `Python` and `Kotlin` and more frameworks, technologies and languages for frontend and backend development. and life goes on.
